## üìñ Introduction

Develop a platform for generating high-quality, photorealistic 3D models from 2D images aimed at revolutionizing advertisement photography. This solution leverages cutting-edge AI techniques to reduce the environmental impact and costs associated with traditional product photography.

## üéØ Goals

    Environmental Impact: Minimize the carbon footprint of traditional photography by replacing it with a digital workflow.
    Cost-Effective: Reduce costs involved in physical product setups and logistics.
    Innovation: Integrate various AI components to transform 2D images into photorealistic 3D models seamlessly.

## ‚ú® Features

    AI-Driven Photogrammetry: Convert high-resolution images into detailed 3D models using advanced AI techniques.
    Custom Workflow Integration: Utilize ComfyUI to create bespoke workflows tailored to our AI-enhanced pipeline.
    Cloud Deployment: Enable mass usage with cloud-based deployment options for scalability and accessibility.

## üöÄ Getting Started
### Prerequisites

    High-resolution 2D product images
    Optional: LiDAR scans for enhanced depth accuracy

### Installation

#### Open terminal/bash

git clone [https://your-repository-link-here](https://github.com/martintmv-git/photogrammetry.git)
cd open3d

#### Open conda terminal and run these commands in the same sequence as shown below.
conda create -n open3denv python=3.6

conda activate open3denv

conda install -c open3d-admin open3d==0.8.0.0

pip install -r requirements.txt

## üß∞ Tools and Techniques

    Open3D: For 3D photogrammetry and model processing.
    ComfyUI: Custom interface for workflow management.
    Stable Diffusion and ControlNet: For realistic texturing and rendering.

## üõ† How It Works

    Capture: Use a LiDAR-equipped camera to acquire 3D data points.
    Model: Transform point clouds into detailed 3D models.
    Enhance: Apply AI-driven enhancements for texture and realism.
    Output: Generate a high-resolution, photorealistic 3D model ready for use.

## üì∑ Suggested Images

    Workflow Diagram: A schematic of the process from image capture to 3D rendering (ideal at the start or in the "How It Works" section).
    Screenshots: Interface of the ComfyUI showing the workflow in action.
    Examples: Before and after images of 2D images and their 3D model counterparts.

## üåê Ethical Considerations

    Data Privacy: Ensure all images used comply with intellectual property laws.
    AI Ethics: Maintain transparency in AI processes to avoid biases.

## üìà Impact

By leveraging this platform, businesses can significantly cut down the time and resources spent on product photography, while still achieving high-quality visuals for e-commerce and advertising.
